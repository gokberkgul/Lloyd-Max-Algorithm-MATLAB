# Lloyd-Max-Algorithm-MATLAB

This MATLAB file shows you how to quantize using Lloyd-Max-Algorithm on MATLAB. It calculates the error using power of the signal. Cuts the algorithm if the improvement is less than %0.01
This script also includes functions for calculating power, uniform quantization and nonuniform quantization. You can compare the error difference between uniform and nonuniform quantization as well. To use it, just redefine y as your signal, sample num as the length of y and histogram resolution.
